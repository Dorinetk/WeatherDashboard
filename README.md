## Usage 
As a user, I have to travel to a specific town and would like to know the weather forecast for that day. I visit the site: https://dorinetk.github.io/WeatherDashboard/, and type the name of that city in the search bar. Then the weather forecast displays on the right hand site.
I can search for other cities to compare and adjust my travel plan.
